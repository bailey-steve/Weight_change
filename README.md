# Weight change

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI project to estimate weight change based on person, exercise and diet.


## Background

Maintaining a healthy weight is important and as someone who used to be obese, I know it can be difficult to find the right combination of diet and exercise to achieve this. What works for ones person doesn't work for another. Some people have limited time or equipment for exercise. People like different foods and the food contain different levels of calories.  




## How is it used?

The AI will initially be trained on wide variety of data from peoples diets and exercises to create a 'generic' AI. This will give results for a typical people i.e. If a typical person eat 2000 calories a day, runs for 30 minutes, sleeps for 8 hours and has an initial BMI of 25 their weight will change by 4% per year. 

The AI can then be refined for the individual. As they track calories, sleep and exercise along with changes to their BMI / weight the AI will more accurately estimate their weight changes in the future, rather than just returning generic results.

Food calorie data from ....

Exercise data from .....

Individual data from ....

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
